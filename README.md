# 🌱 Smart Greenhouse IoT Digital Twin

An IoT-based smart greenhouse system with a real-time **digital twin** that monitors environmental conditions, stores sensor data in the cloud, and visualizes greenhouse status through a web dashboard and 3D digital twin.

This project demonstrates the integration of **IoT hardware, cloud services, and visualization technologies** to enable intelligent monitoring and decision-making for smart agriculture.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The Smart Greenhouse IoT Digital Twin continuously collects environmental data such as temperature, humidity, and other sensor readings from a physical greenhouse setup. This data is transmitted to the cloud and reflected in a digital twin that represents the greenhouse’s real-time state.

The system helps users:
- Monitor greenhouse conditions remotely
- Visualize sensor data through a web interface
- Understand real-time changes via a digital twin representation
